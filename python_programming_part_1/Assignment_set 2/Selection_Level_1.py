# Problem Statement

#TODO Write a python program to find and display the product of three positive integer values based on the rule mentioned below:

#* It should display the product of the three values except when one of the integer value is 7. 
# #*In that case, 7 should not be included in the product and the values to its left also should not be included.

# If there is only one value to be considered, display that value itself. If no values can be included in the product, display -1.

# Note: Assume that if 7 is one of the positive integer values, then it will occur only once. Refer the sample I/O given below.



# Sample Input:    

# sample Input  :       1,5,3      ||     3 , 7, 8            ||  7, 4, 3        ||   1, 5, 7           
# Expected Output:        15       ||        8                ||   12            ||     -1

# def find_product(num1,num2,num3):
#     product=0
#     #write your logic here
#     return product

# #Provide different values for num1, num2, num3 and test your program
# product=find_product(7,6,2)
# print(product)




#? SOLUTION

def find_product(num1,num2,num3):
    product = 0
    if num1 == 7:
        product = num2*num3
    elif num2 == 7:
        product = num3
    elif num3 == 7:
        product = -1
    else:
        product = num1*num2*num3
    return product

print(find_product(5,5,7))
