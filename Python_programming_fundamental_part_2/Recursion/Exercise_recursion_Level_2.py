# Consider that the human tower is to be performed on a stage and the stage has a maximum weight limit. 

# Write a python program to find the maximum number of people at the base level such that the total weight of tower does not exceed the maximum weight limit of the stage. 

# Assume that:
# 1. Each person weighs 50 kg 
# 2. There will always be odd number of men at the base level of the human tower.
